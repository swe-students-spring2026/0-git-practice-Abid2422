#Software Engineering as a Job

I came across a blog which I found really interesting and relevant to anyone looking into getting a job in Software Engineering: [Software Engineering Life & Style — Programming Percy](https://programmingpercy.tech/blog/software-engineering-life-style/).

## Why It Stood Out to Me

It is interesting becausse it doesn't only look at it from a technical point of view but rather as a way of living. It talks about habits, mindset, and how the work we do shapes how we approach problems in everyday life. Instead of focusing solely on tools or languages, it emphasizes learning and the human side of engineering.

## Personal Takeaway

I think this perspective is valuable because it helps shift the focus from “what do I need to learn next?” to “how do I grow as a developer?”. That view is often missing yet it’s critical for long-term growth and satisfaction in this field.


I agree with Ruby's point
## Comment from Ruby

I like how this article frames software engineering as more than just coding. 
The emphasis on process, maintainability, and teamwork matches what we are practicing with Git workflows in this class.
